## Step By Step Mask RCNN Installation

**Attention❗️** 
* This application was made for the 2021 UAV competition, it is strictly forbidden to use it in any competition.
* The purpose of this application is to detect red colored objects and determine the appropriate distance to it.

🔺 **Step 1:** Download nececary npm 
>npm install opencv [More informations about cv2][cv2]

🔺 **Step 2:** İnstall nececary pip
>pip install numpy [More informations about numpy][numpy]
 
🔺 **Step 3:** OPENCV-DetectingColor-FindingDistance published by Mustafa is cloned from the GitHub repository.
>git clone https://github.com/mustafakendiguzel/OPENCV-DetectingColor-FindingDistance.git

🔺 **Step 4:** 
>Find the object who has red color,then measure length and width
>Fill your measured values with known_width and known_distance
>upload a photo named 'resim.jpg'(in this photo there could be some other things or you can be seen thats not problem)
